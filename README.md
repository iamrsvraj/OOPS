# OOPS

Some sample OOPs concept will be seen by solving some problems by OOPs concept

1. Design a class called Student with the following details about the student:
a. Name
b. Age
c. Roll Number - unique
d. Branch
e. Latest Roll No
So, this class with have overloaded constructors -
A. Default constructor
B. Constructors with all fields as parameters 

 There will be setter and getter methods for the fields of the class. 
 Define a toString method that prints all the fields in Student class.
 ‘Latest Roll No’ field of the class will be static containing latest roll number. A new
student when added gets his or her roll number after incrementing this status
counter. 
 Initialize the students’ information by storing information about 10 students. That is,
create an array of type Student of size 10 and then instantiate each element.
 Print the information about students’ by just calling object.toString().
